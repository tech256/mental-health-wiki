# Find Support

DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS ALONE!
The [#mental-health-public](https://tech256.slack.com/archives/mental-health-public) is just one community.
You *are* important and your mental health challenges do not lessen your value.
Find and connect with people who love you and support your success over the challenges.

# Educate yourself

As a developer, you should be all too familiar with being called a "professional" and collecting a paycheck when you honestly have no clue what is going on.
Doctors do the same thing.
Psychiatrists do the same thing.
Some are better than others, just like some developers are better than others.

This is aother reason you should not do this alone. 
Don't let the only opinion be your doctor's opinion.

# General tips

Regardless of what you are challenged with...

## Measure your symptoms

Without data, you have nothing objective to measure progress.
Begin measuring your symptoms.
The [PHQ-9](#) is a good bi-weekly measurement for depression, for instance.

Once you begin measuring, you can being tracking if lifestyle changes, medications, treatments, etc are providing you with progress.

## Bloodwork

Be sure your doctor does some bloodwork to eliminate physical ailments as the root cause of your symptoms.
Low levels of iron or vitamin D can contribute to depression, for instance.
Unhealthy lipid levels can likewise.

If you decide to include medication as part of your treatment, consider taking the [blah](http://blah) test.
This will inform your health care provider of what classes of medications will be most effective for your treatment.

## Stay Active

Software and technology professionals tend to live sedentary lives.
The combination of the lack of activity and indoor living can contribute to mental illnesses.
Be willing to take a break and walk outside in the sunshine.
Consider joining a gym where you will find both physical activity and community.

## Vitamins and Nutrition 

Some people feel continuously fatigued because they're eating a garbage diet.
Take the time to find a healthy diet you can follow and commit yourself to it.
Keep taking your measurements and see if it makes a difference.

Furthermore, make sure you are intaking vitamins which are good for your mental health.

### Vitamins for depression

If you struggle with symptoms of depression, be sure to supplement the following:

1. Omega 3
2. Folic acid (if not prescribed Deplin or Enlyte)
3. B12 (see also Enlyte)
4. Lithium Orotate 
5. Zinc
6. Vitamin D (according to the results of your bloodwork)

### Vitamins for anxiety

TBD

### Alcohol

While alcohol can be a wonder drug for us struggling with mental illnesses, it can in the long-term compound the problem.
Honestly evaluate your consumption and ask yourself if you are self-medicating.
Consider cutting back and see how it affects your symptoms.

### Caffeine

Symptoms like fatigue are commonly self-medicated with caffeine.
Over use of caffeine can quickly turn fatigue into anxiety, exchanging one problem for another.

## Sleep

Sufficient and consistent rest is critical for anyone, with or without mental illness challenges.
Several aforementioned items affect your sleep, such as nutrition, caffeine, and activity.
Before addressing rest issues with supplements or medication, consider how your lifestyle is affecting your ability to sleep.

### Vitamins/Supplements

Before addressinsg sleep issues with medications, consider using the following:

1. Valerian root
2. Melatonin 

## Therapy/Counseling

Not many of us have gotten here without scars.
Traumatic life events and challenges throughout our lives contribute heavily to our mental health.
Talking to friends and family is vitally important, but strongly consider adding a therapist/counselor to your treatment.

Bear in mind that just as with doctors, there are varying levels of competence and numerous philosophies in therapy.
Don't expect the first therapist you meet to be the best fit for you.

## Medication 

Before taking *any* medication, fully discuss any side-effects and alternatives with your health care provider.
Don't blindly accept the first suggestion.
All medications come with side-effects, and medications for your mental health are no exception.

Take into account if there are generic alternatives available if finances are a concern.

Most mental-health medications should be phased in and out of your system.
Ask if you should initially take 1/2 or 1/4 the dosage when beginning a new medication.
If your doctor says "no," double check with another source.

Too overwhelming? 
Consider taking a trusted loved one with you to help sort through the options and details.
